## Covid-19 Karnataka

I started extracting data from daily reports generated by govt of karnataka health dept. I have daily reports from 11th of april till present date.

I download it from the Karnataka official [Telegram group](https://t.me/Karnataka_KoViD19_Broadcast).


[`Sample report`](Evening%20Media%20bulletin%20COVID-19,%2020.04.2020%205pm%20English%20(1).pdf)

Tasks done
1. I have extracted the data related to confirmed cases and stored it in [`processed_data.csv`](processed_data.csv)


To do:
1. Extract suspecteed and isolated level data. (The number people getting hospitalised tells more about how the infection is spreading, and how many the +ve cases can estimated for following days)
2. Extract data related to covid testing
3. Fetch and extract demographic data(area name, ward no etc)
4. Create charts for visualisation.

I will also be updating the repo, requiremts.txt and also some analysis on the data.
